            <h3 class="messageContent">One of the three members of the informatino technology department is definitely an odd person. The other day, he was talking about some new file upload system that can be used to put files onto the server since email was apparently insecure.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="messageContent">He also somehow manages to contradict himself often, I can almost garuntee that he, like the rest of us, uses an inseure password for his main computer. The guy was so excited yesterday because he found that he can put his phone in his top pocket and the way he did it made everyone laugh at him. Not that he noticed anyway.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="messageContent">Though he did mention something about a new dhcp thingo that he named mauricemosscomputer and he doesn't need to use his ip address to talk to his PC since it has that name now.</h3>
